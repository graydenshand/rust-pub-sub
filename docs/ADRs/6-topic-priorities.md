# 6. Topic Priorities

Server can be configured to prioritize some topics over others, such that when the server is congested the messages
published to higher priority topics are processed first.

This feature could be useful for a system admin to prioritize certain workflows which demand a higher degree of reliability.
This allows many applications to use the server without disrupting the higher priority workflows.
